    title: "Why we still love original anti-minimalist William Morris",
    content:
      "Although the original Morris & Co folded in the 1930s, the Sanderson group acquired the archive, and has continued to print the designs ever since. Seeking to explain their continuing popularity, Claire Vallis, creative director of the Sanderson Design Group, cites a number of reasons. 'There's the nostalgia of them – people remember them from their childhoods – and then there's such storytelling in his designs that I think people really connect with them. A design like Strawberry Thief was inspired by Morris looking out of his window and seeing thrushes picking the strawberries which he found very amusing and created a story around.' The Morris aesthetic – with its vibrant patterns, full of intricate detail – is also a perfect fit for the current love of maximalism, eclecticism and nostalgia in interior design, a look referred by some on social media as 'cluttercore'",

      "From converted barns and factories to stackable ateliers, what is the ultimate live-work space? Clare Dowdy talks to designers and creatives about their set-ups around the world.",
    content:
      "Some designers and architects have had live-work set-ups for years. Their light-touch conversions of industrial spaces into aesthetic ateliers have long been an inspiration to others. 'Conservation is a great starting point. Designers did it out of necessity, they couldn't afford to knock it all down and start again,' says developer Simeon Anderson. Now that many of us are likely to continue working from home to some degree, what can we learn from these old hands? Because perching at the kitchen island or squatting in the spare bedroom ad infinitum isn't the answer. There's a risk that quality of lives (both home and work) will suffer. 'This last year has been about making do,' says architect Richard Parr, 'now it's about creating a proper space.'",
